# E-Course Recommendation System

This project is an E-course recommendation system built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Flask (Python)** - Backend Framework

- 📚 **User Interests** → 🎓 **Completed Courses** → 🔄 **Adaptive Recommendations**

- 📊 **Sentiment Analysis** → 🤝 **Collaborative Filtering**

- 📏 **Pearson Correlation** → Similarity Measurement

- 🔍 **Cosine Similarity** → **Course Matching**

- 📄 **Pandas** → **Data Processing**

- 🔐 **Firebase** → Real-time Data & Scalability

- 💻 **Jupyter** → **Development & Experimentation**

## Objective

This system aims to provide personalized and dynamic course recommendations to users based on their learning history and interests.

### Technologies Used

- Flask (Python) for backend
- Sentiment Analysis & Collaborative Filtering for generating recommendations
- Pearson and Cosine similarity for measuring course relationships
- Pandas for data processing and handling CSV files
- Firebase for real-time data and scalability
- Jupyter for development and experimentation

---

## How it Works

- Initially, the recommendations are based on the user’s interests.
- After users complete courses, the recommendations adapt based on their previous course choices.
- The system continuously improves course suggestions using collaborative filtering, sentiment analysis, and various similarity measures like Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity.

## Future Improvements

- Integration of more advanced algorithms for course recommendations
- User profiling based on learning behavior and preferences
- Real-time feedback mechanism for users to rate recommendations
